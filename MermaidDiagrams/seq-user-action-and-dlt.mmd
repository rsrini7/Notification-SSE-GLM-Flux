    Note right of KafkaOrch: Outbox Poller publishes the event...
    KafkaOrch->>+Orchestrator: 4- Orchestrator consumes READ event

    alt Happy Path
        Orchestrator->>+Geode: 5a- Puts user-specific event into 'sse-user-messages' region
        Geode-->>-Orchestrator: 
        Orchestrator-->>-KafkaOrch: 6a- Acknowledges orchestration event

        Geode-->>+Worker: 7a- CqListener on worker for user-xxx is invoked
        Worker->>Worker: 8a- Sends 'MESSAGE_REMOVED' via SSE
    else DLT Path (Orchestrator Fails)
        Orchestrator-->>+KafkaOrch: 5b- Throws exception after retries
        Note over KafkaOrch, DLT: Spring Kafka Error Handler routes to DLT
        KafkaOrch->>+DLT: 6b- Publishes failed orchestration message
        DLT->>+DLTConsumer: 7b- Admin service consumes from DLT
        DLTConsumer->>+DB: 8b- Saves DLT message for review
