    AdminSvc->>+DB: 1- Writes ONE orchestration event (type=CANCELLED) to Outbox
    DB-->>-AdminSvc: ...

    Note right of KafkaOrchestration: Outbox Poller publishes the event...

    KafkaOrchestration->>+Orchestrator: 2- Leader consumer receives event
    Orchestrator->>+DB: 3- Fetches full user list from broadcast_user_targets
    DB-->>-Orchestrator: Returns user list

    loop For each targeted user
        Orchestrator->>+KafkaWorkers: 4- "Scatters" user-specific CANCELLED events to worker topics
    end

    Orchestrator-->>-KafkaOrchestration: 5- Acknowledges orchestration event

    KafkaWorkers->>+WorkerConsumer: 6- Worker pods consume events in parallel
