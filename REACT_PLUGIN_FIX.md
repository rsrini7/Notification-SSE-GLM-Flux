# React Plugin Preamble Error Fix

## Problem
The application was showing the error: `@vitejs/plugin-react can't detect preamble. Something is wrong.` when trying to load React components.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **TypeScript configuration issues** - Missing `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` and `esModuleInterop` flags
2. **Babel plugin configuration** - The Vite config included Babel plugins that weren't installed
3. **React import handling** - The React plugin wasn't properly configured for the project setup

## Solution

### 1. Fixed TypeScript Configuration
Updated `tsconfig.json` to include:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    // ... other options
  }
}
```

### 2. Simplified Vite Configuration
Updated `vite.config.ts` to remove problematic Babel configuration:
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react({
      jsxImportSource: 'react',
      include: '**/*.{jsx,tsx}'
    }),
    rootPathPlugin()
  ],
  // ... rest of config
})
```

### 3. Removed Babel Plugin Configuration
The problematic Babel configuration was removed:
```typescript
// Removed this section:
babel: {
  plugins: [
    ['@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx', {
      runtime: 'automatic'
    }]
  ]
}
```

## Result
- ✅ React plugin preamble error resolved
- ✅ Application loads correctly on `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ All React components compile and render properly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Vite development server runs smoothly

## Verification
The fix was verified by:
1. Checking that the main HTML page loads correctly
2. Verifying that TypeScript compilation passes
3. Testing that React components are properly transformed by Vite
4. Confirming that the application serves JavaScript without errors

The application is now fully functional and ready for development.
