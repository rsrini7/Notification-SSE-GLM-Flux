# PostCSS Issue Fix Complete ✅

## Issue Resolved

### **Problem:**
```
[vite] Internal server error: [postcss] It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.
```

### **Root Cause:**
- Using Tailwind CSS v4 which requires a different PostCSS plugin than v3
- The `tailwindcss` plugin in PostCSS config was for v3, but we're using v4
- Tailwind CSS v4 requires `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin instead

### **Solution Applied:**

#### 1. **Installed Correct PostCSS Plugin** ✅
```bash
npm install @tailwindcss/postcss
```

#### 2. **Updated PostCSS Configuration** ✅
**Before:**
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```
