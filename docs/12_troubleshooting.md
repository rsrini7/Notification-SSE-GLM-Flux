# 12. Troubleshooting

## Motivation
This section provides guidance on diagnosing and resolving common issues encountered when operating the Broadcast Microservice. It covers potential problems related to Kafka, caching, and general system performance.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Message Delays or Backlogs in Kafka

**Problem**: Messages are not being processed in a timely manner, or there's a growing backlog in Kafka topics.

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
- **Head-of-Line Blocking**: If using a single Kafka topic for all message types (e.g., mass broadcasts and targeted alerts), high-volume, low-priority messages can block urgent, low-volume messages. 
  - **Solution**: Implement a dual-topic strategy (e.g., `broadcast-events-all` and `broadcast-events-selected`). This isolates workloads, allows independent scaling, and ensures critical messages are not delayed by bulk processing. Refer to the discussion in <mcfile name="QA.md" path="c:\Users\Srini\ws\Notification-SSE-GLM-Flux\QA.md"></mcfile> for more details.
- **Insufficient Consumer Resources**: The Kafka consumer group might not have enough instances or resources (CPU/memory) to keep up with the message production rate.
  - **Solution**: Scale up the number of consumer instances (pods in Kubernetes) or allocate more resources to existing instances. Monitor consumer lag to identify bottlenecks.
- **Slow Message Processing Logic**: The business logic executed by consumers is taking too long, leading to processing delays.
  - **Solution**: Profile the consumer application to identify slow code paths. Optimize database queries, external API calls, or complex computations. Consider offloading heavy processing to asynchronous tasks if possible.

### 2. Cache Inconsistencies or Performance Issues

**Problem**: Data served from cache is stale, or caching is not providing expected performance benefits.

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
- **Incorrect Cache Eviction/Update Policies**: Cache entries are not being invalidated or updated correctly when underlying data changes.
  - **Solution**: Review cache configuration (<mcsymbol name="CaffeineConfig" filename="CaffeineConfig.java" path="broadcast-microservice/src/main/java/com/example/broadcast/shared/config/CaffeineConfig.java" startline="20" type="class"></mcsymbol>, <mcsymbol name="RedisConfig" filename="RedisConfig.java" path="broadcast-microservice/src/main/java/com/example/broadcast/shared/config/RedisConfig.java" startline="20" type="class"></mcsymbol>) and ensure appropriate eviction policies (e.g., time-based expiry, size limits) and update mechanisms are in place. For distributed caches like Redis, ensure all instances are correctly configured for consistency.
- **Cache Misses**: High cache miss rates indicate that frequently accessed data is not being cached effectively.
  - **Solution**: Analyze access patterns and adjust caching strategies to include more relevant data. Ensure cache keys are consistent and correctly generated.
- **Network Latency to Redis**: High latency between the microservice and the Redis instance can negate performance benefits.
  - **Solution**: Ensure Redis is deployed in close proximity to the microservice (e.g., within the same Kubernetes cluster/region). Check network connectivity and latency metrics.

### 3. Server-Sent Events (SSE) Connection Issues

**Problem**: Users are not receiving real-time updates, or SSE connections are frequently dropping.

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
- **Network Proxies/Load Balancers**: Intermediate network devices might be terminating long-lived SSE connections prematurely.
  - **Solution**: Configure proxies (e.g., Nginx, API Gateways) to support long-polling or streaming connections. Ensure appropriate timeouts are set to allow connections to persist. Verify `Connection: keep-alive` and `Content-Type: text/event-stream` headers are correctly handled.
- **Microservice Resource Constraints**: The microservice instances are running out of resources (e.g., open file descriptors, memory, CPU) due to a large number of concurrent SSE connections.
  - **Solution**: Scale up microservice instances. Optimize resource usage within the application. Increase system-level limits for open file descriptors. Implement connection pooling or more efficient connection management if possible.
- **Client-Side Reconnection Logic**: The frontend application is not robustly handling connection drops and retries.
  - **Solution**: Ensure the frontend has proper reconnection logic with exponential backoff to gracefully handle transient network issues or server restarts.

### 4. Database Performance Bottlenecks

**Problem**: Database queries are slow, impacting overall application responsiveness.

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
- **Missing Indexes**: Frequently queried columns lack proper database indexes.
  - **Solution**: Analyze slow queries and add appropriate indexes to tables. Use database monitoring tools to identify query hotspots.
- **Inefficient Queries**: SQL queries are not optimized or are retrieving too much data.
  - **Solution**: Refactor complex queries, use pagination for large result sets, and ensure joins are efficient. Consider using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (PostgreSQL) to understand query execution plans.
- **Database Resource Constraints**: The database server itself is overloaded (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
  - **Solution**: Scale up database resources (vertical scaling) or consider sharding/replication for horizontal scaling. Optimize database configuration parameters.

### 5. Application Startup or Deployment Failures

**Problem**: The application fails to start or deploy correctly.

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
- **Configuration Errors**: Incorrect environment variables, application properties, or Kubernetes configurations.
  - **Solution**: Double-check all configuration files (`application.yml`, Kubernetes ConfigMaps, Deployment manifests) for typos or incorrect values. Ensure all required external services (Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL) are reachable and correctly configured.
- **Dependency Issues**: Missing or incompatible dependencies.
  - **Solution**: Verify `pom.xml` for correct dependencies and versions. Perform a clean build. Check logs for `ClassNotFoundException` or similar errors.
- **Port Conflicts**: The application is trying to bind to a port already in use.
  - **Solution**: Ensure the application's configured port is available. In Kubernetes, check service and ingress configurations for port conflicts.

## General Debugging Steps
1. **Check Logs**: Always start by examining application logs for error messages, warnings, or stack traces. Increase logging levels (e.g., to `DEBUG`) if necessary.
2. **Monitor Metrics**: Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to observe key metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, network I/O, Kafka consumer lag, and database query times.
3. **Health Endpoints**: Utilize Spring Boot Actuator health endpoints (`/actuator/health`, `/actuator/prometheus`) to check the status of application components and dependencies.
4. **Connectivity Checks**: Verify network connectivity between microservices and external dependencies (Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL) using tools like `ping`, `telnet`, or `nc`.
5. **Reproduce the Issue**: Try to consistently reproduce the problem in a development or staging environment to isolate the cause.
