.SYNOPSIS
    Builds the Java project, copies the necessary JAR file, and builds the
    custom Geode Docker image for local Kubernetes deployment.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates the following steps:
    1. Runs 'mvn clean install' from the 'broadcast-microservice' directory.
    2. Copies the resulting 'broadcast-geode-shared-1.0.0.jar' to the 'geode-scripts' directory.
    3. Builds the custom Geode Docker image tagged as 'custom-geode:1.0'.
